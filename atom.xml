    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve spent the past five months living in Thailand. Now that I&#8217;ve returned
to the land of fast internet and robust coffee beans, it&#8217;s time to move forward with
my Ruby on Rails agenda. To motivate myself, I&#8217;ve decided to set a high goal and
establish a game plan to meet that goal. As a freelancer, it&#8217;s my duty to self-motivate
and challenge myself to become a better developer. There&#8217;s a lot of directions to
be taken in the world of web development and goals will help to choose a path instead
of being scattered in numerous technologies with zero mastery.</p>




<h3>The goal</h3>


<p><a href="http://hashrocket.com/">Hashrocket</a> doesn&#8217;t know it yet but I&#8217;m
going to be an apprentice with them in the near future.</p>




<h3>The reason</h3>


<p>They&#8217;re a progressive company and are the type of team I can see myself in.
They subscribe to agile methodologies and practice pair-programming. It&#8217;s a place
where I know I&#8217;d be challenged, taught, humbled, and involved in some cutting edge
development. A major spotlight is their active contribution to the open source
community.</p>


<p>Needless to say, I&#8217;m a fan.</p>




<h3>The plan</h3>




<p>Hashrocket provides the following requirements for an apprentice:</p>




<ul>
  <li>Passion for developing excellent software</li>
  <li>Basic knowledge of Ruby and Rails</li>
  <li>Enthusiasm about pairing and other Agile practices</li>
  <li>You MUST be able to work full-time at one of our offices</li>
</ul>




<p>Special consideration is given to those who:</p>




<ul>
  <li>Experience test driving application development</li>
  <li>Previous consulting experience</li>
  <li>Open source contributions</li>
  <li>Familiarity with Vim</li>
  <li>Agile (especially pair-programming) experience</li>
</ul>




<p>After finding out all I could about the apprenticeship I came across a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGzB-LOwEmQ">video,</a> by Hashrocket, stating
that all employees see the applications and if you&#8217;re declined they&#8217;ll tell you
why. They welcome people to improve and submit applications again - I&#8217;ve already
reasoned that I&#8217;ll be submitting till I get accepted.</p>




<p>Here is what I&#8217;ll be doing in the next couple weeks before I submit my application:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Read a new book each week (those related to Ruby, Rails, Agile development, etc)</li>
  <li>Devote at least 5 hours a week to an open source project</li>
  <li>Develop a CMS - one from scratch and another using open source resources</li>
  <li>Develop a personal site to represent myself</li>
  <li>Develop an application that makes use of APIs</li>
  <li>Use Vim to develop from here on</li>
</ul>




<p>I should probably stock up on coffee.</p>

    <id>http://codeprivy.com/blog/2014/05/06/the-causation-of-blogging</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I started my first development job, I was advised by another developer to
start a blog and document what I was learning. At the time, it seemed like a novel
idea but it wasn&#8217;t exactly pertinent to my scenario. Being new to development, most
of my time was spent in a chaotic bustle to absorb as much content as possible.
I have two reasons for blogging &#8211; one personal and the other community oriented. First,
writing has always been a vehicle to better process my thoughts. Second, I&#8217;ve benefited
from the blogs of other developers on numerous occasions and want to give back.
I&#8217;ll explain.</p>




<p>It&#8217;s been said numerous times that you don&#8217;t really know something unless you
can effectively teach it. I&#8217;m not aiming to write an introductory course to Ruby
but I do hope to share knowledge and challenge myself to understand all the components
enough to explain them thoroughly. As much as I like being able to copy and paste
a solution from Stack Overflow, in the end, it&#8217;s much more beneficial to understand
why things work the way they do. Writing is a form of processing that takes all
my scattered thoughts and makes them coherent. It&#8217;s my hope the blog will serve
as a resource to improve my understanding as I progress.</p>




<p>Recently, I sat down to get started on a freshly cloned Rails project and
couldn&#8217;t get the project&#8217;s gems to install. Some foreign error wasn&#8217;t allowing me
to proceed and I spent roughly 2 hours trying all sorts of debugging.
After swallowing my pride, I ran to Google with the error and found that other
developers had experienced, as well as solved, the error I was burdened by.
Point blank, I benefit from the thoughts and knowledge of other developers and
feel inclined to give back. In a sense, it&#8217;s my way of giving back to the
community so that it can continue to be furthered and improved.</p>




<p>With that said, I hope my code snippets can save someone else some time as
well as increase my understanding of the code at hand. </p>




<p>Here&#8217;s to better coding.</p>
