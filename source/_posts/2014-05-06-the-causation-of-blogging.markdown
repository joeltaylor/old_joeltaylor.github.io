<p>When I started my first development job, I was advised by another developer to
start a blog and document what I was learning. At the time, it seemed like a novel
idea but it wasn't exactly pertinent to my scenario. Being new to development, most
of my time was spent in a chaotic bustle to absorb as much content as possible.
I have two reasons for blogging -- one personal and the other community oriented. First,
writing has always been a vehicle to better process my thoughts. Second, I've benefited
from the blogs of other developers on numerous occasions and want to give back.
I'll explain.</p>

<p>It's been said numerous times that you don't really know something unless you
can effectively teach it. I'm not aiming to write an introductory course to Ruby
but I do hope to share knowledge and challenge myself to understand all the components
enough to explain them thoroughly. As much as I like being able to copy and paste
a solution from Stack Overflow, in the end, it's much more beneficial to understand
why things work the way they do. Writing is a form of processing that takes all
my scattered thoughts and makes them coherent. It's my hope the blog will serve
as a resource to improve my understanding as I progress.</p>

<p>Recently, I sat down to get started on a freshly cloned Rails project and
couldn't get the project's gems to install. Some foreign error wasn't allowing me
to proceed and I spent roughly 2 hours trying all sorts of debugging.
After swallowing my pride, I ran to Google with the error and found that other
developers had experienced, as well as solved, the error I was burdened by.
Point blank, I benefit from the thoughts and knowledge of other developers and
feel inclined to give back. In a sense, it's my way of giving back to the
community so that it can continue to be furthered and improved.</p>

<p>With that said, I hope my code snippets can save someone else some time as
well as increase my understanding of the code at hand. </p>

<p>Here's to better coding.</p>
