<p>My name is Joel and I want to become a better developer than I was yesterday.</p>

<p>In 2012, I graduated with a B.A. in English and have since worked an
eclectic assortment of jobs (that's what I get for majoring in English). Long story
short, I've always tinkered around with web development and landed a position
as a junior developer (focus on Wordpress development) for a local startup.</p>

<p><strong>It was love at first site crash.</strong></p>

<p>I started my first dev job with a <em>very basic</em> understanding of development
and instantly fell in love with solving the problems that I encountered. Suddenly,
my free time began to consist of learning beyond the basics.</p>

<p>Currently, I make a living by freelancing while I continue to embark on my
journey to become a better developer. Wordpress development wet my appetite but
I've since then received an infatuation with Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy hammock camping, playing the banjo, and reading Russian
literature.</p>
